You can use the jamfile in the vmd/test directory to 
run the tests for this library. From the vmd/test directory:

 bjam toolset=xxx
 
where xxx is a compiler on your system.

The VMD library has been tested with VC++ 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
with clang, and with gcc 4.3.0 on up. It may work with other
compilers which have a C++ standard preprocessor and variadic
macro support.
