The library has changed to adhere to the new directory structure
of potential Boost libraries for Modular Boost. This means 
that to use the library the end-user needs to add the 
library to an existing Boost directory structure. This can
be done by:

1) Cloning the git library from 
   https://github.com/eldiener/variadic_macro_data.git
   into a subdirectory of the boost/libs directory called
   'vmd'.
   
   OR
   
1) If you have already cloned the library to some directory,
   git export the library to a subdirectory of the boost/libs directory 
   called 'vmd'.
   
2) Within the boost directory structure make a symbolic link of 
   boost/boost/vmd to boost/libs/vmd/include/boost/vmd.
   
The library is a header only library. This means that in order
to use the library you only need to include the correct vmd header
file. As an example to use the BOOST_VMD_IS_EMPTY macro you would:

 #include <boost/vmd/vmd_is_empty.hpp>
 
and then invoke the macro in your code.
