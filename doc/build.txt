The library comes with full documentation with an index, 
in both HTML and PDF format. However, you can use the 
jamfile in the doc directory to regenerate the documentation 
for this library. 

Add '--enable-index' to the command line to have an index 
with the documentation. Add 'pdf' on the command line to
regenerate the PDF documentation.

You can use the jamfile in the test directory to 
run the tests for this library.

The library has changed to adhere to the new directory structure
of potential Boost libraries for Modular Boost. This means 
that to test the library the end-user needs to add the 
library to an existing Boost directory structure. This can
be done by:

1) Cloning the git library from 
   https://github.com/eldiener/variadic_macro_data.git
   into a subdirectory of the boost/libs directory called
   'vmd'.
   
   OR
   
1) If you have already cloned the library to some directory,
   export the library to a subdirectory of the boost/libs directory 
   called 'vmd'.
   
2) Make a symbolic link of boost/boost/vmd to boost/libs/vmd/include/boost/vmd.

Version information and history information are 
now part of the generated HTML documentation.

You can also of course use the Boost newsgroups 
to ask questions and make comments or suggestions 
about the library.
