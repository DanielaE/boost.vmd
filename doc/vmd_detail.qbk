[section:vmd_detail Functional groups]

The macros in VMD can best be explained as falling into three groups.
These are:

# Macros which add low-level preprocessor functionality.
# Macros which verify a Boost PP data type.
# Macros which control internal variadic data functionality.

A further general explanation of each of these groups follow, while 
a specific explanation for each macro can be found in the reference 
section.
