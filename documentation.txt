The library comes with full documentation with an index, 
in both HTML and PDF format. 

For the HTML documentation invoke vmd/index.html.
For the PDF documentation invoke vmd/vmd.pdf.

You can use the jamfile in the vmd/doc directory to regenerate 
the documentation for this library. From the vmd/doc directory:

 bjam toolset=xxx
 
where xxx is a compiler on your system.

Add '--enable-index' to the command line to have an index 
with the documentation: 

 bjam --enable-index toolset=xxx
 
Add 'pdf' on the command line to
regenerate the PDF documentation:

 bjam toolset=xxx pdf
 
You can add both together for PDF documentation with an index: 
 
 bjam --enable-index toolset=xxx pdf
