This is the Variadic Macro Data library, or VMD for short. 
The Variadic Macro Data library is a library 
of variadic macros which enhance the functionality in
the Boost preprocessor library ( Boost PP ). The library
may also be seen as a repository for future enhancements to
the Boost PP library functionality using variadic macros.

In order to use the library please see the install.txt file.
In order to use the documentation please see the documentation.txt file.
In order to run the test please see the tests.txt file.

Atlanta, Georgia. I am always looking for exciting projects 
on which to work for a living.

You can also of course use the Boost newsgroups 
to ask questions and make comments or suggestions 
about the library.
